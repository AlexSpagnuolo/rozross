    <p>Getting started only requires a 20 minute online test and a one hour conversation. We will explore how you can improve your EQ by looking at your leadership report and exploring your score on 15 different skills which are directly related to your emotional competency. We may identify some blind spots and with that awareness you may be able to transform the way you act and react in a variety of situations. You will leave the session with a personal action plan and a greater awareness of how you act and react to the people and events around you.</p>
