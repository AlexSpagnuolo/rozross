testimonials:
  testimonial1: Roz coached me while I was undertaking my first acting executive role. It was a stressful time and she helped me through it by asking questions that allowed me to figure out what I really wanted to do with my career. Not only did her coaching help me professionally but also personally. Through our regular sessions I came out with tools and techniques to be more mindful and self-aware. I truly feel that without Roz's coaching I wouldn't be where I am today and I highly recommend her services!
